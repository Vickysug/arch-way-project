## My Task

To build a website for a mental health charity. 

## User Story

The Arch-Way Project is a charity based in Halifax, West Yorkshire, UK. It was set up for the purpose of increasing the health and well-being of local communities, especially those living with mental health issues and who are isolated and lonely. The free services include music, dance art sessions and more.
